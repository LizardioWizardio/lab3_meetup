Does this organization value centralized or de-centralized control? Does that organization value quick response to change or comprehensive sign-offs? As a result, changing your meeting cadence is essentially changing your company culture.</p> <p>You can improve your organization’s meeting culture by giving meetings a structure, establishing ground rules for conduct, and empowering a moderator. Change at this scale doesn’t happen overnight, and it doesn’t happen without resistance, but it is essential to a strong agile transformation. Saahil will discuss how to establish a meeting cadence of the various agile ceremonies that is closely aligned to the 9 Scaled Agile SAFe Principles and how making these changes will impact your entire organizational culture. He will also emphasize the need to explicitly empower organizational change agents who can act as “watchdogs” of inefficiency and meeting bloat. You will learn how to eliminate anti-patterns, slim down your meeting cadence, and drive delivery through short feedback loops and quick, purposeful communication that will allow your organization to achieve strong strength of unity and purpose and enable you to reach your goals.</p> <p>About our Speaker: Saahil Panikar is an Agile Transformation Consultant, SPC, at Blue Agility, who has worked with several Fortune 500 companies, Federal Agencies and technology startups since 2009. In a previous life, he worked as a Business Analyst and Data Scientist and has extensive experience in Data Mining and Big Data. He holds a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and a master’s degree in International Business, both from the University of Florida.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="cell"><b>Time:</b> 6:00 25/1/2018</div><div class="long-cell"><b>Name:</b> January 2018 Quantum Computing Meetup</div><div class="long-cell"><b>Location:</b> New York 11 Time Square, NY NY  (NE corner of 41st and 8th avenue)</div><div class="desr"><b>Description:</b> <p>Our next meetup will be from 6-8pm on Wednesday, January 24, 2018.

We’ll present Via’s methodology for addressing the driver incentive side. Offering drivers personalized promotions to get them to work exactly when we need them requires a combination of a couple of different components, each of which is complex on its own:</p> <p>• Predicting how each driver responds to each promotion</p> <p>• Selecting the appropriate promo for each driver to hit attendance targets at the lowest cost</p> <p>We’ll go over why predicting how drivers respond to monetary incentives is a complex problem, and the active academic research on the topic. We’ll then explain the different models we built and how we selected an appropriate model, and how we tied the models to an optimization module to make promo recommendations on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>About the Speakers:</p> <p>Aleks Sinayev (<a href="http://asinayev.github.io/" class="linkified">http://asinayev.github.io/</a>) is a data scientist at Via (<a href="https://ridewithvia.com/" class="linkified">https://ridewithvia.com/</a>) Transportation working on building datasets and models used to describe and predict driver behavior as well as designing and analyzing experiments.

Doors will open at 6:30pm and presentations will start at 7:00pm. Hope to see you there!</p> <p>Many thanks to our host this month: MongoDb!</p> <p>========== Talks ==========</p> <p>Traits</p> <p>The talk will be an introduction to traits and trait objects in rust. I will start by going over why traits are useful, how one creates and uses them, then visit a few details such as the Sized trait and unsafe marker traits like Send and Sync. I might mention trait inheritance, but I really want to focus on how traits can be used to create generic code, through runtime polymorphism or compile time generics, while visiting how Rust's traits differ from similar mechanisms in a language like C++ and a language like JavaScript (inheritance and interfaces vs. duck typing vs. trait based generics.) If there's time at the end I may mention RFCs that might change how we use traits in the future.</p> <p>Taylor Foxhall is a software engineer at Bloomberg L.P. where I code C++ all day. I'm a programming language fanatic, and Rust is at the top of my list of favorite programming languages. I also drink probably an unhealthy amount of tea everyday ☕.</p> <p>==========</p> <p>* Reach out to the meetup group if you'd like to give a presentation or get involved!</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="cell"><b>Time:</b> 6:30 25/1/2018</div><div class="long-cell"><b>Name:</b> Treat the Cause Not the Symptoms: Identifying and Solving for Waste in Business</div><div class="long-cell"><b>Location:</b> New York550 Madison Avenue</div><div class="desr"><b>Description:</b> <p>Please RSVP with the host, Sam, as well.

We’ll swap books and other media. Above all, we’ll PRACTICE and get GOOD.</p> <p>One benefit you get from attending is the group support of learning. Last time we met we watched a couple of hours of a newly available DVD set called “In the Room with Milton Erickson.” It’s how Erickson taught Ericksonian Hypnosis. Up to maybe a dozen people would squeeze into his office and listen to him speak and watch him do demos. Now YOU can be in that room too. It’s pretty amazing, really, and SO instructive.

There is also a Thursday evening class every other week that focuses more on games (short-form improv), though all the improv classes will have elements of both short and long-form.</p> <p>-- Are you a bit shy and looking to get more comfortable with your public speaking?</p> <p>-- Are you a working professional hoping to be a bit more spontaneous during your meetings and interactions with co-workers?</p> <p>-- Or are you an actor or improv comedian looking to take your craft to the next level or get more reps?</p> <p>Then this is the class for you! In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of scene work (role playing). You'll be on your feet quite a bit as I'm believer that you learn (and have more fun) through doing rather than hearing an instructor talk. Brief individual notes will be given, if that's what you're looking for, and tailored to your level of experience. At the end of each class, I'm confident you'll feel a sense of accomplishment that will leave you more energized and excited to tackle the challenges of everyday life, whether at your work place or in your personal life.</p> <p>Each class is $10, and the fee is used to help cover the cost of the room rental and marketing costs.</p> <p>Hope to see you there,</p> <p>Steve</p> <p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/improvnow" class="linkified">http://www.facebook.com/improvnow</a></p> <p>Steve Ling is an alumnus of the improv programs of the Upright Citizens Brigade, Peoples Improv Theater, Magnet Theater, &amp; Annoyance Theater.

Early stage investors such as Seed, Angel, and Venture Capitalists were surprised to discover that they have been disrupted by the ICO crowdfunding method in the Internet/tech market segment.</p> <p>We will delve deeper into ICOs and how they play a crucial role in the growth of the next generation of tech companies that are leveraging blockchain technology. Whether you are curious about blockchain startups, this new funding vehicle, a prospective or active ICO investor, or just want to heckle and bitshame because you think Bitcoin is one of the largest Ponzi schemes the world has ever seen, please come out and join the discussion! And YES! There will be brews courtesy of WeWork!</p> <p>Discussion topics will include:<br/>- Blockchain fundamentals</p> <p>- What is an ICO?</p> <p>- How to launch a successful ICO?</p> <p>- Regulatory Concerns</p> <p>- The ICO market</p> <p>- Benefits and Risks of Interacting with Cryptocurrency</p> <p>- The Future Outlook</p> <p>- EVENT WILL BE LIVE STREAMED!</p> <p>Disclaimer: This presentation is for educational purposes only and is NOT financial advice. ICOs are NOT suitable for all startups, nor are they a simple funding vehicle to replace traditional early stage capital. They can be highly effective for specialized technology offerings.</p> <p>What is Bunker Brews?<br/>A monthly meet-up or happy hour where the Bunker Labs community — veterans, military spouses, and civilians alike can network with subject matter experts, investors, thought leaders, and more — creating a robust environment for growth and development. We showcase veteran start-ups, have discussions with leading entrepreneurs and network with community leaders. These events include pitch competitions, panel discussions, networking opportunities, beer and more! We welcome all veterans, military personnel, entrepreneurs, innovators, intrapreneurs and community leaders.</p> <p>What is Bunker Labs?<br/>Bunker Labs, a national nonprofit, is built by veterans and provides educational programming, access to resources, and a thriving local network to help military veterans and their spouses start and grow businesses.</p> <p>Subscribe to Our Newsletter!<br/>Fill out the form to get our Newsletter every other week and stay up-to-date on the latest:</p> <p>Veteran-Entrepreneur News and Inspiration<br/>Business Education and Workshops<br/>Bunker Labs Community Events around the USA<br/>Subscribe Here: <a href="http://info.bunkerlabs.org/newsletter-subscription" class="linkified">http://info.bunkerlabs.org/newsletter-subscription</a></p> <p>Follow Us on Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bunkerlabsnyc" class="linkified">https://www.facebook.com/bunkerlabsnyc</a></p> <p>Tweet Us at Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/@BunkerLabsNYC" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/@BunkerLabsNYC</a></p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Bring an open mind!</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Beer and food will be provided- courtesy of WeWork!</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="cell"><b>Time:</b> 6:00 26/1/2018</div><div class="long-cell"><b>Name:</b> FREE!!

Big Data has brought the promise of doing data science at scale to enterprises, however this promise also comes with challenges for data scientists to continuously learn and collaborate. Data Scientists have many tools at their disposal such as notebooks like Jupyter and Apache Zeppelin &amp; IDEs such as RStudio with languages like R, Python, Scala and frameworks like Apache Spark. Given all the choices how do you best collaborate to build your model and then work through the development lifecycle to deploy it from test into production?</p> <p>IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) provides you with the environment and tools to solve your business problems by collaboratively analyzing data. DSX is now part of the IBM Watson Data Platform which is an integrated platform of tools, services, and data that helps companies accelerate their shift to become data driven organizations. The platform can consume and work on any data source: on-premises or cloud, structured or unstructured, in-motion or at rest, internal or external to an organization. It has five main data and analytics functions (ingest, persist, analyze, deploy, and govern) that can be exercised in any order and any combination. The compose-able services provide APIs that enable customers, business partners, and system integrators to build on and extend these capabilities.With IBM Data Science Experience, you can create Python, Scala, and R notebooks to analyze your data, collaborate with others on your notebooks, add comments, and view a history of your notebooks. You can create a machine learning flow, which is a graphical representation of data, by using the Flow Editor to prepare or shape data, train or deploy a model, or transform data and export it back to a database table or file in object storage and Use visualization's in your notebooks to present data visually to help identify patterns, gain insights, and make decisions. Many of your favorite open source visualization libraries, such as matplotlib, are pre-installed and available on DSX. Data Science Experience machine learning flows use Apache Spark machine learning (SparkML) algorithms to build models. RStudio, included in IBM Data Science Experience, provides an IDE for working with R. DSX has a thriving community which contains resources to help you learn more about data science. Join us on to see an use case driven demo of DSX and how it can help you get started on and/or accelerate your data science journey.</p> <p><i><b>PLEASE NOTE.  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE LIST FOR SECURITY, WE NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  PLEASE ACCESS THIS LINK TO PROVIDE YOUR INFORMATION.  THIS INFORMATION WILL ONLY BE USED FOR BUILDING SECURITY PURPOSES.</b></i></p> <p><br/><b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSek4oGjVeSvJ7sMeMAUM_tP0dHOsMjT6a6IRvgJP-IhmEY7ig/viewform"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSek4oGjVeSvJ7sMeMAUM_tP0dHOsMjT6a6IRvgJP-IhmEY7ig/viewform" class="linkified">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSek4oGjVeSvJ7sMeMAUM_tP0dHOsMjT6a6IRvgJP-IhmEY7ig/viewform</a></a></b> <b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>- 6:00 pm: Pizza and networking<br/>- 6:30pm: Why Data Science on Big Data?

We may play with puppets and theatre and masks and other devices for telling those stories.  We’ll look for the silent characters and give them voices.  We’ll see who’s ganging up on whom and alter some of these coalitions and alliances. <br/> 
We’ll consider some of the difficult situations of our lives and look for some characters who can contribute to addressing those problems. <br/>

We may be looking to change careers or be happier and more productive with the one we have. But the problem is we carry within us beliefs that limit us and cause us doubt, hesitancy and stress.</p> <p>We worry about the future. We feel confused, perhaps upset. We don't know how to get started or keep going. In other words, we're STUCK.</p> <p>We think we are not good enough, our work is not good enough, we will be rejected, we lack enough talent or imagination or commitment or time, we can’t trust the future, we can't trust ourselves, we need more ambition and drive, people won't understand, and on and on and on. We cannot get beyond our fears and start doing our work full-out.</p> <p>We become closeted in our self-expression. We shy away doing our work and from sharing it with others, with the world. We fear criticism. Failure. Rejection. We want to be approved of, to be appreciated and recognized. Being appreciated is not bad, but when it becomes more important than our self-expression, it doesn't bring any fulfillment at all. We are just too self-critical. Tiring, huh?</p> <p>There is nothing holding us back but us. When we see our negative patterns with gentle guidance, we can laugh at the illogic of it all and move into doing our work with passion and inspiration. The seriousness is gone, so our "work" becomes our "play."</p> <p>At this meetup, I use a powerful but gentle method for self-investigation, to get at our deep, underlying beliefs that stop us from fulfilling our dreams to write, dance, paint, sculpt, invent, act, play music, make a movie, cook, create a business, do anything that we want to do.</p> <p>Join us and get to work on the beliefs and fears that stop you from being the fully creative person you secretly want to be -- and by the way, creativity doesn't just mean artistic, it's in all areas of your life. All of life is creative.</p> <p>My promise to you is that you walk away from the meetup feeling rejuvenated, inspired, and with a deep understanding about yourself and why you are holding yourself back from living full-out.</p> <p>Please bring a notebook and pen as we will be doing some written exercises. Also you may want to take notes. The $10.00 fee can be paid at the meetup.</p> <p>I hope to see you soon at our meetup!</p> <p>Let's create!</p> <p>"Where you stumble, there lies your treasure." -- Joseph Campbell</p> <p>Ben, Your organizer</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="cell"><b>Time:</b> 2:00 28/1/2018</div><div class="long-cell"><b>Name:</b> Validate your dumb idea!</div><div class="long-cell"><b>Location:</b> Queens3110 Thomson Avenue</div><div class="desr"><b>Description:</b> <p>• What we'll do<br/>What Is A Dumb Idea?<br/>We Believe That There Is No Such Thing As A "Dumb Idea".

The focus will be on scenework, rather than games, which is considered long-form improv. There is also a Thursday evening class every other week that focuses more on games (short-form improv), though all the improv classes will have elements of both short and long-form.</p> <p>-- Are you a bit shy and looking to get more comfortable with your public speaking?</p> <p>-- Are you a working professional hoping to be a bit more spontaneous during your meetings and interactions with co-workers?</p> <p>-- Or are you an actor or improv comedian looking to take your craft to the next level or get more reps?</p> <p>Then this is the class for you! In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of scene work (role playing). You'll be on your feet quite a bit as I'm believer that you learn (and have more fun) through doing rather than hearing an instructor talk. Brief individual notes will be given, if that's what you're looking for, and tailored to your level of experience. At the end of each class, I'm confident you'll feel a sense of accomplishment that will leave you more energized and excited to tackle the challenges of everyday life, whether at your work place or in your personal life.</p> <p>This class is $10. If money is an issue for you, let me know and we can work something out. The cost goes to pay for the cost of the room rental, Meetup fees, and website.</p> <p>Hope to see you there!</p> <p>Steve</p> <p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/improvnow" class="linkified">http://www.facebook.com/improvnow</a></p> <p>Steve Ling is an alumnus of the improv programs of the Upright Citizens Brigade, Peoples Improv Theater, Magnet Theater, &amp; Annoyance Theater.

Your goals are your abstract desires. They can include: find a romantic partner, losing/gaining weight, getting a new job, cultivating a garden, planning a new vacation, gaining more friends, making more money, learning a new skill. Your weekly task will be decided by other members. These can take the form of: run 5k in Central Park this Saturday at 9am, incorporate your company at 7pm Tuesday, create a dating profile tomorrow at 7pm). Members will also vote on how many points you'll get if you provide photo evidence and complete your task. Each group has a target number of points within a specific period of time. If that target is reached, the group gets a reward, such as club hoodies. Being a member is totally free, but it costs to actually play the game because it's better for your motivation and has a strong psychological impact. You should only pay if achieving your goals and stretching yourself is worth at least that much to you!</p> <p>Where is your meeting location?<br/>We meet at 116th and Broadway. You can get there by taking the 1 train to 116th station, or Columbia University. The gates on 116th and Broadway is where we'll meet before going to our venue, and it's right outside the subway station.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="cell"><b>Time:</b> 21:00 31/1/2018</div><div class="long-cell"><b>Name:</b> Investor Coffee Morning with Lerer Hippeau</div><div class="long-cell"><b>Location:</b> New York158 West 27th Street</div><div class="desr"><b>Description:</b> <p>Join us for an informal chat over coffee where we will welcome Joe Medved of Lerer Hippeau.
